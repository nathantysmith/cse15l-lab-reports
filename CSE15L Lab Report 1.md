# Accessing the course specific account on ieng6:

## Installing Visual Studio Code:
* In order to access the course specific account you will need some type of code editor, the standard for the class is Visual Studio Code
* Regardless of the OS going to the Visual Studio Code website, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), should give straight forward instructions on how to install Visual Studio Code
* Once Visual Studio Code is installed you can launch it and it might have a welcome file already open however with no files open your screen should display as:

## Accessing the class specific account:
* Upon entering the class the school should have generated login credentials specific to the student, such as cse15lwi23xxx, where the xxx is a set of three letters specific to you, you can find these credentials by going to this [website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and logging in with your school PID, once there you should find a button with your unique cse15lwi23xxx formatted ID and once clicking on it will see a blue link to reset your password
* Once you have reset your password, to use this login, simply open the terminal by clicking the terminal button in the upper left tool bar of VSCode and type **ssh cse15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu**, replacing the cse15lwi23xxx with the ID specific to your class and you, this should prompt you with a password request, after typing that in you should be logged into the course server. Do not be worried that you cant see the password when you type it, that is standard.
* Upon logging in you should be prompted with a welcoming message such as:

* Go ahead and test out some commands, there are many commands to try such as: pwd(print working directory) or cd(current directory), they might look something like this:
