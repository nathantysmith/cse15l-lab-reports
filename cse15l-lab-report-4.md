## Step 4
First thing you need to do is log into your iegn6 account, I did this by typing ```cs15lwi23awj@ieng6.ucsd.edu```, if you have created a ssh key already then that will be all that is needed, otherwise you will need to put in your password as well.

## Step 5
Then I cloned the directory onto the account by first copying the ssh version of the url from the forked repository on github and then typing ```git clone <ctrl>c``` to input this to the terminal:

## Step 6
Here, although unnecessary, I used ```ls``` to confirm that the directory lab7 had been cloned, then I used ```cd lab7``` to change my directory before copy pasting the javac and java commands for junit testing, inputting: ```<ctrl>c``` then ```<ctrl>c L<tab>Tests``` to run the tests.

## Step 7
Then, seeing that there is an error in the code somewhere, I open the ListExamples file by typing ```nano L<tab>.java``` to open up a text editor in the terminal.

From there I press ```<down>``` and ```<right>``` until I get down to the error in the code and fix it by pressing ```<backspace> 2``` to repace the 1 in input1 with 2, making it input2.
